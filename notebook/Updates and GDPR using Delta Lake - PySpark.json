You can also look at the original Quick Start guide if you are not familiar with [Delta Lake](https://github.com/delta-io/delta) [here](https://docs.delta.io/latest/quick-start.html). It provides code snippets that show how to read from and write to Delta Lake tables from interactive, batch, and streaming queries.\n",
